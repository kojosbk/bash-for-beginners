    "### Bash Basics Simplified\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the world of Bash! Let's dive into the essentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigating Directories with `cd`:**\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Use `cd` to change directories.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For help, type `help` or `cd --help`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For detailed help, use `man cd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Searching Files:**\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Type `ls` to list files.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` To search, use patterns like `ls S*` (S for starting letter).\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For multiple files, use `ls [CS]`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Specify file extensions like `ls.md` or `ls.exe`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Find any extension with `ls *.??`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For uppercase files, use `ls [[:upper:]]*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Locating Commands:**\n",
    "   - `ðŸ‘‰` Use `whereis` for binary source files.\n",
    "   - `ðŸ‘‰` `which` returns executables.\n",
    "   - `ðŸ‘‰` For everything, try `find`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using `find` to Locate Files:**\n",
    "   - `find . -name \"*.md\"` searches for Markdown files in the current directory.\n",
    "   - `find /home -name file.txt` searches in the /home directory.\n",
    "   - `find /home -iname file.txt` is case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Working with Directories:**\n",
    "   - Create a directory with `mkdir project01`.\n",
    "   - Create nested directories with `mkdir -p project01/sub1/sub2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **File Operations:**\n",
    "   - Create a file with `touch project01/file.txt`.\n",
    "   - Move files with `mv project01/file.txt project02`.\n",
    "   - Copy files with `cp` and remove with `rm`.\n",
    "   - remove a folder `rmdir` folder name\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Viewing File Content:**\n",
    "   - Open files with `cat`.\n",
    "   - Display the first 3 lines: `head -n 3 filename`.\n",
    "   - Display the last 3 lines: `tail -n 3 filename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Bash Commands and Redirection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Viewing File Content:**\n",
    "   - To display more lines of a file: `more fake001.log`.\n",
    "   - Use `grep` to search for a specific IP address: `grep \"174.212.2.233\" fake002.log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Appending to a File:**\n",
    "   - Create a new file: `touch part4.txt`.\n",
    "   - Append the file listing to `output.txt`: `ls -l >> output.txt`.\n",
    "   - View the updated contents: `cat output.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Understanding Environment:**\n",
    "   - Use `env` to see the environment variables.\n",
    "   - `echo env` provides information about the environment.\n",
    "   - `echo $HOME` shows the home directory.\n",
    "   - `echo $USER` displays the current user.\n",
    "   - `echo $PATH` lists all executables in the current path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating and Using Variables:**\n",
    "   - Create a new variable: `export newVar=value`.\n",
    "   - Display the variable: `echo $newVar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Redirection and Output:**\n",
    "   - Redirecting standard output to a file:\n",
    "     - `ls -l > output.txt` saves the file listing.\n",
    "     - `cat output.txt` displays the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Appending to Existing Files:**\n",
    "   - Append the file listing to `output.txt` again:\n",
    "     - `touch part4.txt`.\n",
    "     - `ls -l >> output.txt`.\n",
    "     - `cat output.txt` shows the combined contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Bash Commands and Redirection Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Redirecting Errors to a File:**\n",
    "   - Use `2>` to redirect error output.\n",
    "   - Example: `ls -l ./dir 2> error.txt`.\n",
    "   - View error details: `cat error.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Redirecting Both Output and Errors:**\n",
    "   - Redirect both standard output and errors to the same file.\n",
    "   - Example: `ls -l missing &> all_output.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Files with `cat`:**\n",
    "   - Use `cat` to concatenate and create a new file.\n",
    "   - Example: `cat part1.txt part2.txt > paragraph.txt`.\n",
    "   - View the combined content: `cat paragraph.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Piping Between Commands:**\n",
    "   - The `|` (pipe) operator sends output to another command.\n",
    "   - Example: `ls -l | less`.\n",
    "   - This displays the file listing using `less` for easy navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Manipulating Text Using `head` and `tail`:**\n",
    "   - Use `head` to get the first line of a file.\n",
    "     - Example: `cat part1.txt | head -n 1` (gets the first line).\n",
    "   - Replace `head` with `tail` for the last line.\n",
    "     - Example: `cat part1.txt | tail -n 1` (gets the last line).\n",
    "\n",
