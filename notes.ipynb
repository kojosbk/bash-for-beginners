    "### Bash Basics Simplified\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the world of Bash! Let's dive into the essentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigating Directories with `cd`:**\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Use `cd` to change directories.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For help, type `help` or `cd --help`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For detailed help, use `man cd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Searching Files:**\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Type `ls` to list files.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` To search, use patterns like `ls S*` (S for starting letter).\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For multiple files, use `ls [CS]`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Specify file extensions like `ls.md` or `ls.exe`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` Find any extension with `ls *.??`.\n",
    "   - `[ ]` For uppercase files, use `ls [[:upper:]]*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Locating Commands:**\n",
    "   - `ðŸ‘‰` Use `whereis` for binary source files.\n",
    "   - `ðŸ‘‰` `which` returns executables.\n",
    "   - `ðŸ‘‰` For everything, try `find`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using `find` to Locate Files:**\n",
    "   - `find . -name \"*.md\"` searches for Markdown files in the current directory.\n",
    "   - `find /home -name file.txt` searches in the /home directory.\n",
    "   - `find /home -iname file.txt` is case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Working with Directories:**\n",
    "   - Create a directory with `mkdir project01`.\n",
    "   - Create nested directories with `mkdir -p project01/sub1/sub2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **File Operations:**\n",
    "   - Create a file with `touch project01/file.txt`.\n",
    "   - Move files with `mv project01/file.txt project02`.\n",
    "   - Copy files with `cp` and remove with `rm`.\n",
    "   - remove a folder `rmdir` folder name\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Viewing File Content:**\n",
    "   - Open files with `cat`.\n",
    "   - Display the first 3 lines: `head -n 3 filename`.\n",
    "   - Display the last 3 lines: `tail -n 3 filename`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Bash Commands and Redirection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Viewing File Content:**\n",
    "   - To display more lines of a file: `more fake001.log`.\n",
    "   - Use `grep` to search for a specific IP address: `grep \"174.212.2.233\" fake002.log`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Appending to a File:**\n",
    "   - Create a new file: `touch part4.txt`.\n",
    "   - Append the file listing to `output.txt`: `ls -l >> output.txt`.\n",
    "   - View the updated contents: `cat output.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Understanding Environment:**\n",
    "   - Use `env` to see the environment variables.\n",
    "   - `echo env` provides information about the environment.\n",
    "   - `echo $HOME` shows the home directory.\n",
    "   - `echo $USER` displays the current user.\n",
    "   - `echo $PATH` lists all executables in the current path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating and Using Variables:**\n",
    "   - Create a new variable: `export newVar=value`.\n",
    "   - Display the variable: `echo $newVar`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Redirection and Output:**\n",
    "   - Redirecting standard output to a file:\n",
    "     - `ls -l > output.txt` saves the file listing.\n",
    "     - `cat output.txt` displays the contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Appending to Existing Files:**\n",
    "   - Append the file listing to `output.txt` again:\n",
    "     - `touch part4.txt`.\n",
    "     - `ls -l >> output.txt`.\n",
    "     - `cat output.txt` shows the combined contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Bash Commands and Redirection Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Redirecting Errors to a File:**\n",
    "   - Use `2>` to redirect error output.\n",
    "   - Example: `ls -l ./dir 2> error.txt`.\n",
    "   - View error details: `cat error.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Redirecting Both Output and Errors:**\n",
    "   - Redirect both standard output and errors to the same file.\n",
    "   - Example: `ls -l missing &> all_output.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Files with `cat`:**\n",
    "   - Use `cat` to concatenate and create a new file.\n",
    "   - Example: `cat part1.txt part2.txt > paragraph.txt`.\n",
    "   - View the combined content: `cat paragraph.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Piping Between Commands:**\n",
    "   - The `|` (pipe) operator sends output to another command.\n",
    "   - Example: `ls -l | less`.\n",
    "   - This displays the file listing using `less` for easy navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Manipulating Text Using `head` and `tail`:**\n",
    "   - Use `head` to get the first line of a file.\n",
    "     - Example: `cat part1.txt | head -n 1` (gets the first line).\n",
    "   - Replace `head` with `tail` for the last line.\n",
    "     - Example: `cat part1.txt | tail -n 1` (gets the last line).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Group:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To change the group ownership of a file:\n",
    "  - Command: `sudo chown :root <filename>` or `chgrp vscode <filename>`.\n",
    "  - View changes: `ls -l <filename>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ownership and Permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that `chown` and `chgrp` deal with ownership, while `chmod` deals with permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Permissions with Letters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command: `chmod +x <filename>` (adds executable permission).\n",
    "- View changes: `ls -l <filename>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Permissions with Numbers (Octal):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use octal numbers to represent permission combinations.\n",
    "  - Example: `chmod 755 <filename>`.\n",
    "    - User: rwx (7), Group: r-x (5), Other: r-x (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Octal Permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Restrict access: `chmod 640 <filename>`.\n",
    "  - User: rw, Group: r, Other: no permissions.\n",
    "- Give all permissions: `chmod 777 <folder>`.\n",
    "  - Gives read/write/execute to all users/groups/others.\n",

    "Certainly! Let's add examples for each concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`):**\n",
    "   - Indicates that the script should be interpreted using the Bash shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   #!/bin/bash\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Definition:**\n",
    "   - Functions are blocks of code that can be called by referencing their names.\n",
    "   - Declared using the syntax:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     greet_user() {\n",
    "         echo \"Hello, user!\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Local Scope (`local` keyword):**\n",
    "   - Variables declared with `local` are limited to the scope of the function, meaning they exist only within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   example_function() {\n",
    "       local local_variable=\"I am local\"\n",
    "       echo $local_variable\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Variable Declaration:**\n",
    "   - Variables are declared using the format `variable_name=value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   greeting=\"Hello\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameters in Functions:**\n",
    "   - Functions can accept parameters, allowing flexibility in the values they operate on.\n",
    "   - Parameters are referenced inside the function using the syntax `$1`, `$2`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   greet_person() {\n",
    "       echo \"$1, $2!\"\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   greet_person \"Hello\" \"John\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **If-Then-Else Statement:**\n",
    "   - Conditional statements are used to make decisions in the script.\n",
    "   - The basic syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     if [ condition ]; then\n",
    "         # Code to execute if the condition is true\n",
    "     else\n",
    "         # Code to execute if the condition is false\n",
    "     fi\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   check_number() {\n",
    "       if [ $1 -eq 0 ]; then\n",
    "           echo \"Number is zero.\"\n",
    "       elif [ $1 -gt 0 ]; then\n",
    "           echo \"Number is positive.\"\n",
    "       else\n",
    "           echo \"Number is negative.\"\n",
    "       fi\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   check_number -5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Echo Command:**\n",
    "   - Used to print messages to the terminal.\n",
    "   - Syntax: `echo \"message\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   echo \"This is a message.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Running the Script:**\n",
    "   - Execute the script using the command `bash script_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Assuming the script is named example_script.sh\n",
    "   bash example_script.sh\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Execution Flow:**\n",
    "   - Functions and variable definitions are typically placed at the top of the script.\n",
    "   - The script execution flows from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Define functions and variables here\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Rest of the script\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Function Call:**\n",
    "    - Call a function by referencing its name, followed by any required parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    greet_user\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Scope Example:**\n",
    "    - Demonstrated the concept of local scope by declaring a variable as `local`, making it accessible only within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    example_function\n",
    "    echo $local_variable  # This will result in an error as the variable is local\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Script Organization:**\n",
    "    - Functions and variable definitions are often placed at the top of the script for proper execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # Define functions and variables here\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Rest of the script\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Clearing Terminal (`clear` command):**\n",
    "    - Clears the terminal screen for better visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    clear\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Understanding Errors:**\n",
    "    - Illustrated the importance of defining functions before calling them to avoid errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # Incorrect order leading to an error\n",
    "    greet_user\n",
    "    function greet_user() {\n",
    "        echo \"Hello!\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Preview of Next Topic:**\n",
    "    - Mentioned that scripts can be designed to run multiple times or in loops, introducing the concept of loops as the next topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to copy these examples into a script file and run them to observe the behavior and practice working with these Bash scripting concepts."
